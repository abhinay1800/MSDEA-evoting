# MSDEA: e-Voting Application
In these challenging COVID-19 times, the question on how to deal with the
upcoming elections while maintaining proper social distancing norms has already
been raised by several voices. We have been listening since ages that e-Voting is
the future of election but now we’re right in that future, and that’s our need too.
So, we came up with an easy and secured e-Voting system named
“Modern Secured Digital e-Voting &amp; Analysis” aka “MSDEA”.

It is a web-based application. So, fundamental features related with web-based
technologies such as client server and database properties determine the
software requirements of this system.

## Front-End:

## Working
MSDEA allows member to login with their credentials and securely log one vote,
we ensure that each vote is transmitted securely without revealing the voter
details.
It also allows the concerned authority to manage the Candidates, Voters and
other things through the specially designed Admin Panel.
## Conclusion:
MSDEA presents numerous advantages over traditional voting system. In the
initial stage there will be of course a little cost for planning and introduction.
But, in the long run and with a widespread introduction, this e-Voting system will
lead to a new revolution in elections, and many cost savings too.
